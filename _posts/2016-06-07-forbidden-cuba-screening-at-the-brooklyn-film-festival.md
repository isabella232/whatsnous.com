"Forbidden Cuba" is a dramatic comedy. It follows Gil Bigelow, an American businessman sent on a covert mission to Cuba to find an executive gone rogue and plant the seeds for future business expansion. On arrival, Gil quickly gets swallowed in the unknowns of Havana. Traveling deeper into the island, he's stripped of his routines, gadgets and bearings, and finds his eyes opened to the beauty and vibrant culture of Cuba - challenging his corporate directives, his identity and everything he's known. Without permits, permission or a Plan B, "Forbidden Cuba" was filmed guerilla-style on location to reveal a nation on the verge of dramatic change. Colliding narrative storytelling with documentary filmmaking, it's both a cautionary tale of an American conquistador in Cuba and the first American feature filmed on the island since the revolution of 1959.
