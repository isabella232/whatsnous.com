### Nous Entertainment LLC is an independent production company focused on the development, marketing and distribution of film and television programming aimed at balancing entertainment with issue-driven content.

In the past decade, several dynamic forces have converged to make Nous Entertainment a reality. Today’s technology, content distribution models and a changing economic environment have paved the way for emerging production companies to successfully conceive of, and execute on, compelling programming and stories. 
Our venture and private equity-funded business model provides us the flexibility to strategically partner and support projects that align with our mission and goals – distribute inspiring, illuminating and entertaining stories that celebrate the human intellect.
Nous Entertainment is an east coast-based Limited Liability Corporation.

# Our Leadership

The firm’s mission and goals persisted, separately, within the hearts and minds of co-founders Adam Scherr and Suzan Binder for decades before Nous Entertainment was officially created. Following a routine coffee meeting, the long-time friends serendipitously recognized that they shared a passion to elevate the visibility of inspiring narratives and programming. At that time, Nous Entertainment LLC was formed and has grown rapidly to include the leadership and counsel of several prominent leaders in distribution, venture financing and private equity. 

**Adam Scherr**, *Co-Founder and Executive Chef*, drives business strategy for Nous Entertainment. Overseeing the day-to-day operations, Mr. Scherr has served as lead writer on several of the company’s productions. His daily responsibilities range from working with writers and fellow producers to strategizing with investors and financial managers. 

Mr. Scherr has an extensive history within digital and traditional media. He has a proven track record of working with complex issues including ecumenical, financial, healthcare reform and entertainment. As a National Media Director, Mr. Scherr led a team of 60 health writers navigating a Wild West of health journalism and editorial commentary for the Owner of the award-winning The Christian Science Monitor (csmonitor.com). He was hired to help the church strengthen relationships with key industry voices at the New York Times, CBS, FOX, The Washington Post, LA Times and others. After great success, he expanded his remit to media and audiences in both Albany, NY and Capitol Hill. 

Mr. Scherr has extensive experience driving business culture turnarounds. As a consultant, his first client was an independent filmmaker and his most recent was an international church with a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper. His diverse background in entrepreneurialism, business management, media relations, social cause management, film and theater give him a unique perspective that helps companies and organizations both navigate and thrive in complex culture of the 21st century. 
He also founded and built Infinitee Kids Corp., a high-end graphic apparel line for children. Under his leadership, sales grew quickly and products were carried by Barneys, FAO Schwarz and 100s of retailers throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe.

**Suzan Binder**, *Co-Founder and Chef de Cuisine*, is the creative and energetic force behind Nous Entertainment. Ms. Binder’s tireless commitment to artistic pursuits and her cause-centric interests serve to drive the creative direction of the company and its partnerships.  

**Amy Thompson**, *Menu Manager*, is a communications professional who has served in leadership and client-counseling roles at several of the world’s pre-eminent communications and public relations firms.
