# Our Leadership

The firm’s mission and goals persisted, separately, within the hearts and minds of co-founders Adam Scherr and Suzan Binder for decades before Nous Entertainment was officially created. Following a routine coffee meeting, the long-time friends serendipitously recognized that they shared a passion to elevate the visibility of inspiring narratives and programming. At that time, Nous Entertainment LLC was formed and has grown rapidly to include the leadership and counsel of several prominent leaders in distribution, venture financing and private equity. 

**Adam Scherr**, *Co-Founder and Executive Chef*, drives business strategy for Nous Entertainment. Overseeing the day-to-day operations, Mr. Scherr has served as lead writer on several of the company’s productions. His daily responsibilities range from working with writers and fellow producers to strategizing with investors and financial managers. 

Mr. Scherr has an extensive history within digital and traditional media. He has a proven track record of working with complex issues including ecumenical, financial, healthcare reform and entertainment. As a National Media Director, Mr. Scherr led a team of 60 health writers navigating a Wild West of health journalism and editorial commentary for the Owner of the award-winning The Christian Science Monitor (csmonitor.com). He was hired to help the church strengthen relationships with key industry voices at the New York Times, CBS, FOX, The Washington Post, LA Times and others. After great success, he expanded his remit to media and audiences in both Albany, NY and Capitol Hill. 

Mr. Scherr has extensive experience driving business culture turnarounds. As a consultant, his first client was an independent filmmaker and his most recent was an international church with a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper. His diverse background in entrepreneurialism, business management, media relations, social cause management, film and theater give him a unique perspective that helps companies and organizations both navigate and thrive in complex culture of the 21st century. 
He also founded and built Infinitee Kids Corp., a high-end graphic apparel line for children. Under his leadership, the company quickly grew to over $300K in annual sales and was carried by Barneys, FAO Schwarz and 100s of retailers throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. 

**Suzan Binder**, *Co-Founder and Chef de Cuisine*, is the creative and energetic force behind Nous Entertainment. Ms. Binder’s tireless commitment to artistic pursuits and her cause-centric interests serve to drive the creative direction of the company and its partnerships.  

**Joseph Stephans**, *Consulting Producer and Lead Line Chef*, began his career during New York’s independent film wave of the 1990s. He has worked on over 30 films along with dozens of television series and several commercials in a variety of environments – ranging from NYC to the Virgin Islands to the White Mountains and Amish country. Whether ultra-low budget (Girls Town), mid-budget (Requiem For A Dream) or colossal budget (The Good Shepherd), Mr. Stephans has been helping filmmakers achieve their vision with expertise in management and logistics for decades. Most recently, he produced the Killer Films feature, Wildlike, starring Bruce Greenwood.

**Vickery Eckhoff**, *Writer and Maitre D’*, is a New York City-based writer who routinely covers important political and social issues. Her coverage of the horse slaughter trade has been at the forefront of an ongoing discussion by the news media, legislators, lobbyists, industry and the public. Her Forbes article on Paula Bacon (on which “The Judas Horse” is based) was the first to chronicle slaughter’s exploitation, not just of horses, but of small-town people and their way of life. This true story has been cited by lawmakers—from US congressmen to members of Parliament in Canada—looking to shut down this unregulated industry. Part of an extensive, popular series praised for its accuracy and research, Ms. Eckhoff’s writing has also exposed the pipeline of racehorses to slaughter, wild horse politics and roundups (Forbes); billionaire welfare ranchers (Alternet and Salon); and horse drugs and food hazards (Newsweek/The Daily Beast and the Huffington Post).

**Amy Thompson**, *Menu Manager*, is a communications professional who has served in leadership and client-counseling roles at several of the world’s pre-eminent communications and public relations firms.
