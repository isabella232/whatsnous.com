**Proud Mary is the true story of the writer’s family, and centers on a young, black, Christian girl from Indiana and her eventual rise to become the Yiddish speaking matriarch of a large Jewish family in Baltimore. It chronicles the life of Mary Sharpe and her despair over the sudden loss of her family as a result of a train crash in rural Indiana. Eventually a twist of fate brings her to the Levine household in Baltimore, where over the ensuing years of her life, and through love, laughter and tears, she rises to the role of beloved Matriarch. From the fear and torment of a threatening relationship, Mary finds a safety net in this quirky family's unconditional love.**

### Adam Scherr

*Writer, director, producer*

Adam Scherr has a proven track record of working with complex issues: ecumenical, financial, healthcare reform, entertainment and more. As a National Media Director, Adam led a team of 60 health writers helping them navigate the wild west of health journalism and editorial comment for the owner of The Christian Science Monitor (csmonitor.com). He was specifically hired to help the church with its media outreach in New York City and state. He quickly helped facilitate and build relationships with CBS, The New York Times, Fox News, The Washington Post, LA Times, CNN and many others. Seeing the results the media team received, the legislative team pulled him in to do the same in both Albany and Capitol Hill.

Adam has extensive business culture turnaround experience. His first client was an independent film-maker and his latest an international church with a Pulitzer Prize winning newspaper. His diverse background in entrepreneurialism, business management, media relations, social causes, film and theater gives him a unique perspective to help companies and organizations navigate and thrive in this complex 21st century culture. Adam also founded and built Infinitee Kids Corp. Infinitee was a high end graphic tee shirt line. The company quickly grew to over $300K in yearly sales and was carried by Barneys, FAO Schwarz and 100’s of retailers throughout the US, Canada and parts of Europe.
