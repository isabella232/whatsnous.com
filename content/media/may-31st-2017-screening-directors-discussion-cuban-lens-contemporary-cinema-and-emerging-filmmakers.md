Cuba is currently in the throes of unparalleled change. Cubans are encountering U.S. citizens as new tourists to their country while Americans are being transformed by their recent engagement with the island. The mystique of change and the intensity of encounter rarely afford U.S. audiences a deep knowledge of contemporary Cuban culture in its sophistication, tradition and breadth. Cuban cinema is a powerful force that can help to shape the moment.

Cuban Lens, a one-day film showcase at NYU’s King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center, offered context and clarity about recent Cuban changes through film. It presented emerging filmmakers whose short works capture this transformation.

The evening included a conversation with directors Marcel Beltrán, Zoe Miranda and scriptwriter Alán González.

Cuban Lens was curated by Jesús Hernández, a producer and filmmaker who runs Bach Media.
