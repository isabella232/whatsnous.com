During a career of more than 35 years, Juan González has become one of the nation’s best-known Latino journalists. A staff columnist for New York’s _Daily News_ since 1987, he has also been co-host for the past 18 years of _Democracy Now!,_ a daily morning news show that airs on more than 1,300 public and community radio stations in the US and Latin America.

Gonzalez’s investigative reports on urban affairs, the labor movement, the environment, race relations and political troubles in Latin America have won widespread recognition, including two George Polk awards for commentary and a 2004 Leadership Award from the National Hispanic Heritage Foundation.

He has authored four books, including _Harvest of Empire: A History of Latinos in America._ First published 15 years ago, _Harvest_ has become one of the most popular introductions to Latino history on US college campuses, and a documentary feature film based on the book and narrated by González was released in 2012.

Among his three other books are, _News for All the People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media,_ and _Fallout: The Environmental Consequences of the World Trade Center Collapse._ He is currently completing a study of the new populist movements that have come to power in various American cities.

One of the original founders of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists (NAHJ), González served as the association’s president from 2002-2004 and was elected to its Hall of Fame in 2008.

Even before he entered journalism, González distinguished himself as a leader of the Young Lords, a militant civil rights organization of the late 1960s, and of the National Congress for Puerto Rican Rights in the 1970s.

Born in Ponce, Puerto Rico, he was raised in East Harlem and Brooklyn, New York. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Columbia University, has been a visiting professor in public policy at Brooklyn College.
