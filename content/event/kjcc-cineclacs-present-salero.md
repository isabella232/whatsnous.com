**About the film:** The world’s largest salt flat, Bolivia’s Salar de Uyuni, is a pristine, otherworldly expanse of white. For generations, the only signs of life have been the “saleros” who harvest salt from its radiant surface. This remote region is thrust into the future when Bolivia’s leaders embark on a plan to extract a precious mineral found beneath the salt crust, and to build an infrastructure connecting the Salar to the outside world. Salero, a nonfiction feature film, is a poetic journey through the eyes of Moises, one of the last remaining salt gatherers. Set at the dawn of the modern age in one of the most secluded places on earth, Moises’ story explores how identity is formed by both tradition and progress.

**About the director:** Mike Plunkett (Director and Producer) is a New York-based director, writer and editor for film and television. His short films have been shown at the Sundance Film Festival, the Queens Museum, the Director’s Guild of America, and aired on PBS. Salero is his first documentary feature film and has garnered awards from The MacArthur Foundation, Tribeca Film Institute, San Francisco Film Society, and New York State Council for the Arts, among others.

**This event is free and open to the public. ID is required to enter the building.**
