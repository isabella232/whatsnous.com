**The Limit of Our Gaze** is a showcase of Spanish non-fiction films directed by women and a series of panel discussions and Q&A’s with the guest filmmakers attending. The aim of the symposium is to reflect upon the aesthetics, poetics and political parameters in which Spanish non-fiction productions are made today and the limits, frontiers and trademarks of the feminine gaze. Access to the American market is often complicated for independent productions, so the documentary films to be showcased will allow American audiences, curators, distributors and programmers to have access to the current non-fiction Spanish panorama. In addition, the guest filmmakers will have the opportunity to network with relevant professionals from the film industry in NYC establishing valuable connections develop an international film presence. Curated by **Ruth Somalo** and **Lur Olaizola**. Produced by **Laura Turégano**. Guest Filmmakers: **Mercedes Álvarez, Neus Ballús, Cecilia Barriga, Virginia García del Pino, Pilar Monsell,** and **Sandra Ruesga.**
