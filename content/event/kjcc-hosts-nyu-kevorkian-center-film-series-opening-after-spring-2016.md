**AFTER SPRING** (2016, 98 minutes)

This documentary, executive-produced by Jon Stewart, follows refugee families in transition and aid workers fighting to keep the Zaatari refugee camp running. With no end in sight, Syrian families must decide if they can rebuild their lives in a place that was never meant to be permanent.

After-film discussion with co-directors **Ellen Martinez** and **Steph Ching.**
