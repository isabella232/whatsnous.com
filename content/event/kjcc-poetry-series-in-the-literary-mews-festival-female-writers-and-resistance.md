**KJCC Poetry Series**, curated by Lila Zemborain, presents the discussion **"Female Writers And Resistance"** in the context of **The Literary Mews Festival**, NYU's initiative for [PEN World Voices Festival of International Literature](https://www.facebook.com/PENworldvoices/):

"This timely conversation will focus on the writer's individual approaches to activism and resistance in writing practice, and explores politics, gender, and identity through the lens of the female writer."
