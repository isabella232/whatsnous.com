A journey across Spain’s geography through its most relevant foods, from cheeses to wine to olive oil, its fish preserves spices or its coveted ham. A collection of photographs by various artists that highlights the iconic foods of Spain and their relationship to the land and the people. An exhibition designed by [Manuel Estrada](http://www.manuelestrada.com/) for Foods and Wines from Spain. This exhibit is part of [Eat Spain up!](http://www.eatspainup.com/)

A retrospective of [Manuel Estrada](http://www.manuelestrada.com/)´s work on and around food. This exhibition explores the Spanish designer´s conceptual work at pulling apart the everyday elements of food we take for granted, transforming them into works of art. Estrada´s design with food include food packaging, corporate imaging, print and digital publications.

[Eat Spain up!](http://www.eatspainup.com/) is a cultural event that introduces you the food and culture of Spain. Join us in New York City for a week-long journey of food & wine tastings, cooking classes, chef master classes, film screenings, art exhibitions, and more. During the [<u>Food & Culture Sessions</u>](http://www.eatspainup.com/our-activities/category/food-culture-sessions/) we will explore the regions of Madrid, Burgos and Extremadura. These sessions include a short food travel documentary, an open discussion with our guest chefs, and a full tasting of new and traditional dishes.
