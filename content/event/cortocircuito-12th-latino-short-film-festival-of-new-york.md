Corto Circuito was formed ten years ago to showcase short films made by filmmakers from and about Latin America, Spain and the United States.

The festival is unique in its mission to promote a wider and deeper understanding of the roots, life and diverse cultures of the Spanish and Portuguese speaking communities.

Each year, the selections include animated and fictional short films, as well as documentaries and experimental works, many of which will be U.S and N.Y. premieres.
