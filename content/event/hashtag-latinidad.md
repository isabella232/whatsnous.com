This panel will engage the potential and problematics of social media from a Latin@ perspective. Bringing together a scholar, an influencer, and a writer/performer, the panel seeks to move beyond simply celebratory or cautionary approaches in an effort to capture the complexity of Latin@ social media. We also hope to explore the hashtag as a tool for research, activism, and community and creative work. #HashLat.

Panelists: **Jillian Báez** (College of Staten Island, CUNY), **George Torres** (Sofrito Media Group, @urbanjibaro), and **Jennifer Tamayo** (writer, performer, Managing Editor for Futurepoem). Respondent: **Juan González** (Andrés Bello Chair, King Juan Carlos Center)

**_Hosted/organized by Urayoán Noel (English, Spanish and Portuguese) and sponsored by Borders and Diasporas and the Latino Studies Program._**
