**_[Food Ecologies: Spaces of Production and Consumption in 21st Century Cuba](http://www.kjcc.org/uploads/1481054530707_Food-Ecol%C3%B3gica.m4a)_** delved in the dynamics of production, distribution, preparation, consumption, and commercialization of food in contemporary Cuba. Acclaimed food writer **Anya von Bremzen** and awarded director **Asori Soto** commented on their most recent projects, having both returned from Cuba, where von Bremzen conducted research in preparation for her next book on Cuban _paladares_ (privately-owned restaurants legalized in the 1990s) and Soto was filming for AirBnB while editing his documentary _Cuban Food Stories_.

**Anya von Bremzen** and **Asori Soto** talked with **María A. Cabrera Arús**, Postdoctoral Fellow at the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center. Introduced by **Ana Dopico**, Director of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at New York University.
