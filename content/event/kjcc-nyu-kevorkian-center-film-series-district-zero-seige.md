**DISTRICT ZERO**
(Spain, 2015, 65 minutes)
Directed by Pablo Iraburu and Jorge Fern√°ndez Mayoral

Maamun opens the door to his shop, like he does every other morning. It is a tiny white container. Next to it is an identical container, and then another, and another. Thousands of containers stretch as far as the eye can see, all of them exactly the same. We are in one of the biggest refugee camps in the world: Zaatari, in Jordan. His shop repairs mobile phones. Maamun starts to serve his customers. Their memory cards contain their past in Syria: happiness, routine, family life. And then the war came, followed by destruction, fear and flight. Maamun rebuilds photos and sound, recovers lost content, recharges batteries, and restores the only link his neighbours still have with Syria. He and his friend Karim have decided to provide a new service: printing off the photos which have filled up the mobile phones of the people who live in Zaatari.

**SIEGE**
(Syria, 2015, 9 min)
This short documentary shot by residents of the Yarmouk refugee camp in Damascus weaves four stories together to give intimate insight into life in the camp.

This screening is part of the "Loss and Resilience, Film and Commentary on The Syrian Refugee Crisis" series.
