## With Marta Dillon, Verónica Gago and Cecilia Palmeiro

In the last decade, a powerful movement against femicide and gender inequality reignited and transformed public conversations on feminism and politics. The #NiUnaMenos movement in Argentina and Latin America has been a laboratory of these new discourses and forms of intervention.

Marta Dillon, Verónica Gago and Cecilia Palmeiro –activists of #NiUnaMenos– will discuss the history and perspective of the movement in a public conversation in Spanish and English.
