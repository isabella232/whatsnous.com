This panel will engage the potential and problematics of social media from a Latin@ perspective. Bringing together a scholar, an influencer, and a writer/performer, the panel seeks to move beyond simply celebratory or cautionary approaches in an effort to capture the complexity of Latin@ social media. We also hope to explore the hashtag as a tool for research, activism, and community and creative work. #HashLat.

Panelists: <span>Jillian Báez</span> (College of Staten Island, CUNY), <span>George Torres</span> (Sofrito Media Group, @urbanjibaro), and <span>Jennifer Tamayo</span> (writer, performer, Managing Editor for Futurepoem). Respondent: <span>Juan González</span> (Andrés Bello Chair, King Juan Carlos Center)

__Hosted/organized by Urayoán Noel (English, Spanish and Portuguese) and sponsored by Borders and Diasporas and the Latino Studies Program._ With the support of NYU King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center._
