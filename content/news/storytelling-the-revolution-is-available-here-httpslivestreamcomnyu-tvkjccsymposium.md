**Thursday & Friday, April 21 & 22, 9:00 a.m. – 8:00 p.m.**

**Symposium: Storytelling the Revolution - Narrative and Latin American Revolutionary Politics 1959-2016**

**Symposium directed by** **Jon Lee Anderson, Andrés Bello Chair in Latin American Cultures and Civilizations for Spring 2016\. Journalist, biographer, war correspondent and _New Yorker_ staff writer.**

_**If you missed the symposium you may view it here:** **[http://livestream.com/nyu-tv/KJCCSymposium](http://livestream.com/nyu-tv/KJCCSymposium)**[](http://livestream.com/nyu-tv/KJCCSymposium)_

_**An edited version in Spanish will be also available in the coming weeks.**_

_Storytelling the Revolution brings together distinguished journalists, historians, and political activists who have witnessed, helped narrate, and in some cases personally participated in, Latin America's revolutionary experiences from 1959 to the present day._

_We will consider how the story of revolution in the Americas has been told over the last half century, and how those narratives have been enshrined or contested. Across two days, participants will reconsider the recent history of Cuba, Colombia, Argentina, Chile, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Venezuela and their own roles in shaping the story._

_The symposium engages and questions narratives of Cold War, democratization, socialist revolution and civil war and traces the after-lives and ongoing legacy of armed and civil struggle in the hemisphere. As the US and Cuba put an end to their epic standoff, and the hemisphere's longest-lasting Marxist rebellion - and its last civil war - winds to an end in Colombia, what conclusions do we draw? How have the storytellers of revolutionary change shaped our political imaginations? How does the idea of revolution persist? What has this history and these acts of telling meant in the American hemisphere? Where do we go from here?_
