The landscape may have changed, but the South Bronx is still home to photographers committed to documenting their neighborhoods from the inside. Chief among them are the members of the Bronx Photo League, a group whose recent Jerome Avenue Workers Project looks at a blue-collar community facing development and gentrification. Join us for a conversation with shooters David "Dee" Delgado, Nina Robinson, Rhynna Santos and Edwin Torres as we explore changing neighborhoods, technologies and audiences.

_In partnership with [Bronx Documentary Center](http://bronxdoc.org/), [The Loisada Center](http://loisaida.org/), [Tools of War](http://www.toolsofwar.com/) and [Tats Cru](http://tatscru.net/)._
