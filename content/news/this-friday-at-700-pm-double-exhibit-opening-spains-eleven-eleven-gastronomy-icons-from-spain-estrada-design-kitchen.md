You are invited!

A journey across Spain’s geography through its most relevant foods, from cheeses to wine to olive oil, its fish preserves spices or its coveted ham. A collection of photographs by various artists that highlights the iconic foods of Spain and their relationship to the land and the people. An exhibition designed by [Manuel Estrada](http://www.manuelestrada.com/) for Foods and Wines from Spain.

A retrospective of [Manuel Estrada](http://www.manuelestrada.com/)´s work on and around food. This exhibition explores the Spanish designer´s conceptual work at pulling apart the everyday elements of food we take for granted, transforming them into works of art. Estrada´s design with food include food packaging, corporate imaging, print and digital publications.
