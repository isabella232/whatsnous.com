New York City is exciting in the autumn. From our threshold on Washington Square, the season brings a different light and a new energy. September inaugurates a new academic year and an exciting Fall season at the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at New York University. I began my tenure as Director a year ago, in September 2014, as the first Latina Director of the KJCC. As a scholar of the Americas, the Global South and Cuba, and a Cuban–American, it is an honor to continue the Center’s mission and lively history. It is also a pleasure to consider its future and its many constituencies in a changing cultural and intellectual landscape. We hope to give new expressions to the KJCC’s traditions of public scholarship and cultural engagement as the Center approaches its twentieth birthday in 2017.

With Associate Director Laura Turégano, and the KJCC Advisory Board it’s my great pleasure to welcome you to our new virtual home: our beautifully redesigned website. Feel free to explore the history of the Center, news and details about events and programs, enjoy the site’s new images and accessibility, and learn about the public conversations, the lectures, readings, film screenings, exhibitions and performances that will light up the KJCC this fall. Discover the research initiatives, conferences, and academic projects that engage students, scholars and the public alike. As we expand the new website, we hope to make available recordings of interviews, lectures, discussions, and to offer visual archives and podcasts to complement the events and the rich cultural and intellectual life connected to the programs and exhibits of the KJCC.

Each semester as part of its mission, the KJCC invites an eminent writer, scholar and intellectual from the Hispanophoneworld to be in residence at the Center. This year, for the first time, the Center’s Advisory Board turned the focus of our _cátedras_ to Journalism, Reporting and Public Intellectual Practices.

We are extremely honored, and I am especially proud, that the pioneering journalist, columnist, and cultural historian Juan González is joining us this Fall 2015 as the first Latino and the first Puerto Rican to hold the prestigious Andrés Bello Chair in Latin American Culture and Civilization at the KJCC. Juan González is a columnist at the _Daily News_ and Co-Host of _Democracy Now_ and a founder of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists.He is the author of the influential _Harvest of Empire:A History of Latinos in America._He is also the author of _Roll Down Your Window: Stories from a Forgotten America_ and of _News For All The People: The Epic Story of Race and the American Media_.

As Chair, Professor González has designed a remarkable series of lectures, events and public conversations on the Puerto Rican Debt Crisis, the history of Latino Studies, the cultural and political legacy of the Young Lords. He will be hosting a dialogue with Lin Manuel Miranda and Sonia Manzano on Latino Performing Artists and their Communities, and discussing Rebel Latino Writers in American Journalism. He will also be teaching a graduate course on Latino American Journalism through the Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies.

We are exceptionally fortunate to have in residence this remarkable journalist, historian and public intellectual, and to bring his interventions and insight on U.S., Latino and Puerto Rican cultural and political history into close dialogue with students, scholars, and the New York community at the KJCC.

From pioneering women filmmakers, to reflections about poetry and translation, from exhibits of Bronx photography to the literary work of Gabriela Mistral, from conferences on Cuba and Angola to concerts and poetry readings, the fall calendar is rich and promising. We look forward to seeing you at upcoming events and to sharing with you the all exciting developments at the KJCC this year.
