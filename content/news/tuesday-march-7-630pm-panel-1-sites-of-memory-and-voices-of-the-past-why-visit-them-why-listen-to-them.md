_In Spain, the systematic violation of human rights during the Franco dictatorship remains an untreated social wound. Forty years of repression have been followed by forty years of democracy, but the state has only haltingly taken up this traumatic legacy._

_Recording and preserving the stories and testimonies of _Franquismo_ has seemed a moral imperative to journalists, writers, social historians, artists, and everyday Spaniards. Together they refuse silence and strive to remake national memory._
