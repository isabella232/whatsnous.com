**Come join us to the first public lecture of Josep Maria Muñoz (Fall 2016** **King Juan Carlos Chair in Spanish Culture and Civilization,** **Historian, Director of _L’Avenç_ magazine)**

In Spain today, one hears old lamentations about new crises. The lasting impact of the 2008 financial crisis and its social consequences have produced a persistent new pessimism, one that has overshadowed the decades of economic growth and social welfare that Spain achieved with a democratic government and integration into the European Union. Catalonia is a crucial element in the current Spanish crisis. From 2010 on, a large, democratic, inclusive movement in favor of the independence of Catalonia has gained a previously unseen (and unforeseen) strength. The words “Farewell, Spain” that poet Joan Maragall wrote in 1898 are now pronounced again, with a new political intention.

Contemporary discourse around Catalonia, and the dream or spectre of its autonomy, however, is not a new movement nor merely a response to the recent national crisis. The “Catalan problem” is rooted in the Spanish political upheavals of 1898, when, amid the collapse of Spanish imperialism, the Catalan cultural renaissance became a national political movement. Since then, political Catalanism has been a fundamental element in the configuration of democracy in Spain. Amid the narratives and the pessimism, disagreements over the past persist, and echoes of the 1898 return to trouble the present.

_Josep M. Muñoz is the Fall 2016_ _King Juan Carlos Chair in Spanish Culture and Civilization_ _and will be in residence at KJCC.
