Organized by NYU Professor **James Fernández**.

The film was screened at NYU King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center when it first came out 15 years ago, and now we will screen the newly remastered version, at this special commemorative event. Director **David Riker** and some of the **film’s cast** will be present at the screening and discussion.

Glenn Lovell wrote in “ Variety”: “A heartbreaking look at the abuses heaped on Latino laborers in New York City, David Riker’s “The City” can take its place beside such postwar neo-realist classics as Rossellini’s “Paisan” and Buñuel’s “Los Olvidados.”
