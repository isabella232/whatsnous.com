We are happy to announce that our mission to foster and promote Spanish and Spanish-speaking cultures is now reaching [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KJCC_NYU).

Through this means, we hope to start new conversations within the NYU community, as well as with our fellow organizations devoted to academic and cultural endeavors in the New York City area.

Like us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/kjccnyu/) and/or follow us on [@KJCC_NYU](https://twitter.com/KJCC_NYU) to keep track of our news, lectures and events.
