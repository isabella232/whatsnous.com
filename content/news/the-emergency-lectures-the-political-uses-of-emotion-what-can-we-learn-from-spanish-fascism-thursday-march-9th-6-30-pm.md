_**More on the Series:**_

_**The Emergency Lectures: Public Scholarship on Power, Culture and Resistance**_

_This series offers public scholarship in an Emergency, presenting thinkers and writers from the NYU intellectual community whose work has an urgent bearing on the present. These experts will present historical and contemporary case studies that can help us to comprehend our political moment and think together, beyond the sense of alarm and anxiety that emergencies provoke. Reflecting on Fascist Europe, authoritarian Argentina, medieval Arab Spain, the Mediterranean, the Global South, the Caribbean, and the United States, the talks will offer historical contexts for the civil and humanitarian emergencies of the present, and provoke conversations that foster our capacity for informed engagement and response._
