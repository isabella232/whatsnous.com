**Sawyer Seminar “Cuban Futures Beyond The Market”**

**Food Ecologies: Spaces of Production and Consumption in 21<sup>st</sup> Century Cuba**

Food Ecologies: Spaces of Production and Consumption in 21<sup>st</sup> century Cuba delves in the dynamics of production, distribution, preparation, consumption, and commercialization of food in contemporary Cuba as a way to understand the socio-cultural forces transforming contemporary Cuban society. Acclaimed food writer Anya von Bremzen and awarded director Asori Soto will talk of their most recent projects in which they explore contemporary Cuban food stories. They have both returned from Cuba, where von Bremzen conducted research in preparation for her next book on Cuban _paladares_ (privately-owned restaurants legalized in the 1990s) and Soto was filming for AirBnB while editing his documentary _Cuban Food Stories_. Anya von Bremzen and Asori Soto will be in conversation with María A. Cabrera Arús, Postdoctoral Fellow at the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center. Introduced by Ana Dopico, Director of the King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center at New York University.

In English and Spanish.

Reception to follow.
