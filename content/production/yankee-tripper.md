Moishe Katzov isn’t your usual 18 year-old American teenager. He’s tall and beautiful,
built of steel, agile, coordinated beyond measure and still has the innocence of a child.

want a Rabbi in the family.” Moishe’s parents completely dismiss the idea.
But Al’s idea opens a door inside Moishe, and even after Al is gone, he can’t stop
himself from thinking about it. Moishe has always been restless, at odds with many
