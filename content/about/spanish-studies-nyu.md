[New York University’s Department of Spanish and Portuguese](http://spanish.as.nyu.edu/page/home) offers comprehensive training at the graduate and undergraduate levels in four broad areas of study: the Spanish and Portuguese languages, Spanish literature and civilization, Spanish American literature and civilization, and Luso-Brazilian literature and civilization.

In addition to the Washington Square campus, [NYU Madrid](http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers1/madrid.html) and [NYU Buenos Aires](http://www.nyu.edu/global/global-academic-centers1/buenos-aires.html) give students the opportunity to study in Spain and in Argentina (single semester, full academic year, or summer). NYU also offer summer abroad programs in Argentina, Dominican Republic, Costa Rica and Spain.

The King Juan Carlos I of Spain Center has proven to be an invaluable resource for the Department as well as for other NYU individuals and entities interested in the Spanish-speaking world. It has become a primary force on campus for the promotion of research and teaching on Spain and Latin America, and serves as a liaison among NYU faculty members from the following academic fields who share a research focus on this region: American Studies, Anthropology, Asian/Pacific American Studies, Business, Economics, Education, European Studies, Film Studies, Fine Arts, Hebrew and Judaic Studies, History, Journalism, Latin American and Caribbean Studies, Law, Linguistics, Literature, Music Performance, Near Eastern Studies, Performance Studies, Philosophy, Politics, Psychology, Public Service, Sociology, and Religious Studies.
