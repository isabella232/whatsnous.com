After her father is savagely assaulted at the family lumberyard, Paula Bacon returns home to Kaufman, Texas, a small, agricultural town entrenched in ol’ boy supremacy. Driven by a sense of ennui and powerlessness, she challenges an illegal horse slaughter plant that also brutalizes the adjacent black neighborhood. The aftermath of slaughter waste ravages the community that is kept marginalized by that same system. Joining forces with a local atheist with nothing-to-lose and a disenchanted resident, Paula pushes through trial and tribulation to expose decades of embedded corruption and a trail of tainted horse blood running from their small town, all the way to Capitol Hill. “Judas Horse” is based on the true story appearing in Forbes: “Texas Mayor Paula Bacon Kicks Some Tail.”
