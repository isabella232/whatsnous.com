After her father is savagely beaten at the family lumberyard, Paula Bacon returns home to Kaufman, Texas and takes on a local equine slaughter plant that brutalizes not just horses, but a small black neighborhood next door. Paula runs for mayor and wins, joining forces with Mary Nash, a local atheist, and Robert Eldridge, who lives behind the plant.

Against huge odds, they shut it down, exposing decades of good ol’ boy corruption and a trail of tainted horse blood running from their small East Texas town, through the state capital and all the way to Capitol Hill. Based on the true story in Forbes: “Texas Mayor Paula Bacon Kicks Some Tail.”
