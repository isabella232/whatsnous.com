**Proud Mary is the true story of the writerâ€™s family, and centers on a young, black, Christian girl from Indiana and her eventual rise to become the Yiddish speaking matriarch of a large Jewish family in Baltimore. It chronicles the life of Mary Sharpe and her despair over the sudden loss of her family as a result of a train crash in rural Indiana. Eventually a twist of fate brings her to the Levine household in Baltimore, where over the ensuing years of her life, and through love, laughter and tears, she rises to the role of beloved Matriarch. From the fear and torment of a threatening relationship, Mary finds a safety net in this quirky family's unconditional love.**
